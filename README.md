# embedded C
This project is intended to study Embedded C programming for microcontrollers. In this study, I used an STM32 ARM Cortex-M processor-based microcontroller. To complete this study, I purchased an STM32 evaluation board, installed STM32CubeIDE, and enrolled in a small Udemy course for Embedded C programming.

This note can be used by students or enthusiasts who want to refer to important concepts in embedded programming. Each C file consists of independent methods and their explanations as comments. These notes, in the form of comments and practical examples, help you understand the core concepts of Embedded C at the microcontroller level.
